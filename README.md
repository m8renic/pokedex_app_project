This project was started for the purpose of a college course.

The goal was to create an application using C++ Builder (or another app building/coding program) with certain functionalities. The theme I settled on is "Pokedex".

For whatever reason the app requires some C++ Builder .bpl and .dll files, so at the moment, it is broken.
It worked fine while the IDE was installed.

Since I'm done with the college course, I don't really have an incentive to continue it.
