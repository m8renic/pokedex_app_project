This project was started for the purpose of a college course.

The goal was to create an application using C++ Builder (or another app building/coding program) with certain functionalities. The theme I settled on is "Pokedex".

For whatever reason the app requires some C++ Builder .bpl and .dll files, so at the moment, it is broken.
It worked fine while the IDE and plugins were installed. If you still want to try it out, you will need:
- RAD Studio 11
- Lockbox C++
- FastReport VLC

Since I'm done with the college course, I don't really have an incentive to continue it.
